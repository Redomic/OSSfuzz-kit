# OSSfuzz-kit

`ossfuzz-kit` is a Python library and CLI tool for programmatically interacting with the [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) project infrastructure.

It provides a high-level, user-friendly interface to:

- Query and filter OSS-Fuzz project metadata (language, repo, build system, fuzzing engines)
- Access historical fuzzing results, coverage reports, and crash statistics
- Run custom fuzzing experiments on existing OSS-Fuzz projects
- Export structured data for integration with research or CI pipelines, dashboards, or automation scripts

This toolkit is built for researchers, automation engineers, and security analysts ‚Äî anyone who wants to explore or extend OSS-Fuzz‚Äôs capabilities without diving into its full infrastructure.

> Developed as part of a GSoC 2025 initiative to build a self-contained, research-oriented OSS-Fuzz interface with modular design and full local reproducibility.

## Installation

**Requirements**: Python 3.8+ and Git

### From [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/ossfuzz-kit/)

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple ossfuzz-kit
```

### From source (for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ossfuzz-kit.git
cd ossfuzz-kit
poetry install
```

---

## Sample Usage

Extensive Docs coming soon

### Python

```python
from ossfuzz_kit.client import OSSFuzzClient

client = OSSFuzzClient()

# Get all project names
projects = client.get_all_projects()
print(len(projects), "projects found.")

# Get info about a specific project
info = client.get_project_details("curl")
print(info["language"], info["repo"], info["fuzzing_engines"])
```

### CLI

#### List all projects

```bash
ossfuzz-kit list-projects

# With a limit
ossfuzz-kit list-projects --limit 50
```

#### Get project details

```bash
ossfuzz-kit project-details zlib

# If you want the raw file
ossfuzz-kit project-details zlib --raw

# disable fallback to API, only use shallow copy
ossfuzz-kit --no-fallback project-details zlib
```

---

## Testing

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/
```

All tests run locally and don‚Äôt require hitting the GitHub API unless explicitly configured to do so.

## Roadmap

This project will exponentially grow over time. Here's what's coming:

### ‚úÖ Project Info
- [x] List all OSS-Fuzz projects
- [x] Fetch project metadata (language, build system, repo)
- [ ] Filter projects by language/library

### üìú Fuzzing Results (WIP)
- [ ] Coverage data by date/project
- [ ] Crash reports + stats
- [ ] Date range filtering
- [ ] Structured JSON output

### ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Fuzzing (Future)
- [ ] Define + run custom fuzz targets
- [ ] Monitor run status
- [ ] Pull down coverage/crashes/results

### üß± Design Goals
- [ ] Modular structure
- [x] pip-installable
- [ ] Docs + examples in progress
- [ ] CLI + Python API supported
